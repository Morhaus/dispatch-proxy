### Bug Report
Definition: A bug is a *demonstrable* problem that is caused by the code in the repository.

1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported. How to use search function? Check out this [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-search-to-filter-issues-and-pull-requests/).

2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or look for closed issues in the current milestone.

3. Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.

4. Include a screencast if relevant - Is your issue about a design or front end feature or bug? The most helpful thing in the world is if we can see what you're talking about. Use LICEcap to quickly and easily record a short screencast (24fps) and save it as an animated gif! Embed it directly into your GitHub issue.

5. Include as much info as possible! Use the Bug Report template below or click this link to start creating a bug report with the template automatically.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment.
